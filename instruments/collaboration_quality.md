# Rating handbook for assessing collaboration quality

This handbook describes nine process dimensions of high quality collaboration, 
as defined and developed by @meier2007. 
When assessing collaborations within Minecraft Utopia, please start by reading over
these dimensions. Then use the rating form to assess each member of a collaboration 
on these dimensions. The rating scale ranges from -2 to 2.

## Dimension 1: Sustaining mutual understanding 

Speakers make their contributions understandable for their collaboration partner. 
When sharing ideas about what to build or how to build it, speakers adjust the specificity
of details and explanations in response to feedback from listeners. 
They make sure they have been understood by eliciting 
feedback from their partner. Listeners focus their attention on what the speaker is 
saying and give verbal feedback on their understanding, 
demonstrate their understanding in an appropriate response, or ask for clarification. 

## Dimension 2: Dialogue management 

A smooth “flow” of communication is maintained in which little time is lost due to 
overlaps in speech or confusion about whose turn it is to talk. Turn-taking is often 
facilitated by means of questions (“What do you think?”) or explicit handovers (“You 
go!”). Speakers avoid redundant phrases and fillers (“um... um”, “or....or”) at the end 
of a turn, thus signalling they are done and the partner may now speak. To the 
observer it is always clear who is talking and who is listening. Before partners start a 
new conversation after a phase of parallel individual work, they make sure they have 
their partners' attention, e.g., by calling their names or by using a meta-statement 
(e.g., “Can I ask you something?”). 

## Dimension 3: Resource pooling 

Groups try to gather as many resources as they can to help them complete their task. 
They may gather ideas and alternatives brought up by group members, they may point out
examples from within the Minecraft world or beyond, and they may note constraints (e.g. 
the task they were asked to complete; how they will be asked to share). 
When new resources are introduced, they are integrated into the shared pool of resources. 
For example, a new idea for how to build a structure might be introduced as an extension of 
someone else's idea, or as a potential resolution to an issue the group had previously discussed. 
Group members make sure that resources which they believe are important are represented as well
as eliciting ideas from other group members. 

## Dimension 4: Reaching consensus 

As teams make decisions about their final product, they discuss the alternatives which have come 
up, making and responding to arguments for alternatives if they initially prefer different options. 
Even if partners agree from the start, they still evaluate their shared preference critically.
The point at which a final decision is reached is clearly identifiable, and all group members
assent to the decision.

## Dimension 5: Time management 

Partners monitor the remaining time throughout their cooperation and adjust their use of time
to match what still has to be done within the time remaining. They check, for example, whether 
the current topic of discussion is important enough to spend more time on, and remind one another of the time 
remaining. Good time management allows partners to finish the task in time without having to rush. 

## Dimension 6: Reciprocal interaction 

Partners treat each other with respect and encourage one another to contribute their 
opinions and perspectives. Critical remarks are constructive and factual, never 
personal. Partners interact as equals, and decisions are made cooperatively. 
All partners assent to the final product.

## Dimension 7: Individual task orientation 

Each participant actively engages in finding a good solution to the problem, thus 
bringing his or her knowledge and skills to bear. He or she focuses attention on the 
task and on task relevant information, avoids distractions, and strives to mobilize his 
or her own as well as the partner’s skills and resources. The participant shows interest 
in the task, enjoyment of the work involved, or satisfaction in the result.

# Adaptation of this handbook from the original

The original instrument @meier2007 contained nine dimensions. Several modifications were made
for this study:

- Omitted "Task division" as tasks were more focused on reaching a joint idea than they were on 
  elaborate realization of that idea. Furthermore, the age of participants meant that complex tasks 
  requiring subtasks was less relevant.
- Omitted the "Technical coordination" dimension as all participants were experienced Minecraft players.
